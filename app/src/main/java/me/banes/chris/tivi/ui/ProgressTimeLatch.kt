/**
 * A class which acts as a time latch for show progress bars UIs. It waits a minimum time to be
 * dismissed before showing. Once visible, the progress bar will be visible for
 * a minimum amount of time to avoid "flashes" in the UI when an event could take
 * a largely variable time to complete (from none, to a user perceivable amount).
 *
 * Works with an view through the lambda API.
